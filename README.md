## Stakeholders

### Transfer College Student - End User  
- Goes out two to three times in a week and generally believes that his mood is below average on average every week.
- They believe that not talking to people makes him feel lonely, however, talking to people you don’t know tends to feel negative.
- They feel that it is easier to talk to friends to feel uplifted than anonymous strangers.
- They feel that having similarities with an anonymous individual they are conversing with doesn’t make much of a difference.
- They personally feel like they would not use our proposed app idea, as they feel it doesn’t mean much if a stranger is giving positive affirmations.
- They feel that tracking steps in a fitness app and accomplishing those goals brighten their day.  
  
  
### Office Worker who works remotely. - End User
- Talks to people in person at the gym every day.
- Feels pretty good in a week and attributes it to talking with friends everyday
- They feel that an anonymous person being in a similar situation would not make them easier to open up. The fact that they are an anonymous stranger they feel, would still make it hard to talk to.
- Would use our app because they don’t want to receive or send anonymous messages.
- They feel that they like interacting on Discord a lot because a lot of servers act like community hubs; kind of acting as a proxy for being in person with other people.
