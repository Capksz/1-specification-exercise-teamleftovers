## Stakeholders

### Transfer College Student - End User  
#### Date: 9/21/2023
#### Goals/Needs:
- They feel that tracking steps in a fitness app and accomplishing those goals brighten their day.
- They personally feel like they would not use our proposed app idea.
- They would rather talk to friends to feel uplifted than anonymous strangers.
- Believes that going outside more correlates to improved mood.
#### Problems/Frustrations:
- Goes out two to three times in a week and generally believes that his mood is below average on average every week.
- They believe that not talking to people makes them feel lonely, however, talking to people you don’t know tends to feel negative.
- They feel that having similarities with an anonymous individual they are conversing with doesn’t make much of a difference.
- They feel it doesn’t mean much if a stranger is giving positive affirmations.

  
  
### Office Worker who works remotely. - End User
#### Date: 9/21/2023
#### Goals/Needs:
- Talks to people in person at the gym every day.
- Feels pretty good in a week and attributes it to talking with friends everyday
- It is harder to put themselves out to strangers than people they know.
- They feel that they like interacting on Discord a lot because a lot of servers act like community hubs; kind of acting as a proxy for being in person with other people.
#### Problems/Frustrations:
- They feel that an anonymous person being in a similar situation would not make them easier to open up.
- Would use our app because they don’t want to receive or send anonymous messages.
- They feel that the issue they have with Discord is that it can be hard joining into on very active conversations, and they often don't stay on topic of the channel.
- It is hard to form lasting connections in anonymous chat.
